This is a small hobby project which will scrape news from several sources, perform sentiment analysis, and determine which headlines are "Good News", then display those to the user in a django web app. 

The web app will also allow users to feed back into the model, and have the model be retrained. 

Later features:
 - user specific models
 - user sepcific blocked words/genres
